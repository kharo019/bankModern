# bankModern
Modern website using React.js &amp;&amp; Tailwind CSS


# Purpose of branch
With this branch I'm able to deploy my website using GitHub Pages however, with React running "npm run deploy" it complies all of the code into a simple folder to be published.
Now it'll be easier to deploy only whats necessary than the whole coding project.
